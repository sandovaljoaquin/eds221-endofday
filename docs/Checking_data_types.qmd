## Checking data types 

```{r}
# Creating a vector 
vec_1 <- c(2, 5, 9, 10, 8, 12, 1, 0)

#Looking at class of vector & what type of variable it stores

class(vec_1)
typeof(vec_1)

# Access the 3rd element and re-store 

vec_1_e3 <- vec_1[3]
vec_1_e3
  
# Access the 1st element and re-store 
vec_1_e1 <- vec_1[1]
vec_1_e1

# Access the 5th thru 7th element and re-store 

vec_1_e5to7 <- vec_1[5:7]
vec_1_e5to7

# Reasssign vec_1 as a character
vec_1_char <- as.character(vec_1)
vec_1_char

# Creating a second vector 

vec_2 <- c(town = "Santa Barbara", 
          location = "Rincon",
          swell = "south")
vec_2

# Look at class 

class(vec_2)

# Length of 3

length(vec_2)

# Create a data frame 

df_1 <- data.frame(region = c("A", "B", "A", "D"),
                   species = c("otter", "great white", "sea lion", "gray whale"), 
                   count = c(12, 2, 36, 6))

df_1

# Return class of the entire dataframe 

class(df_1)

# Return the class of the species column 
class(df_1$species)

# Find the maximum value of the count column and store 

max_count <- max(df_1$count)
max_count
